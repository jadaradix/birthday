birthday
========

PHP. People with whom I am romantically compatible and their star signs.

I'll add some Sass, Grunt and Jade when time allows.

Instructions
------------

The easiest way to get this up and running is to git clone to /var/www/htdocs and hit up [localhost/birthday](http://localhost/birthday). If you're on Windows, get WAMP and git clone to C:\wamp\www - the localhost address will be the same.
